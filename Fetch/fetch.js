Fetch API is the new way to make http requests
XmlHttprequest is still there but fetch is the latest addition to the language
With less code, we can make the request now

Promise returned from fetch() wonâ€™t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), 
and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.
